    "### Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans.\n",
    "    In Python, you can add comments to your code using the '#' character. There are two main types of comments in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Single-line comments: Single-line comments are created using the '#' character.\n",
    "    Everything following the '#' on that line is considered a comment.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Example : # This is a single-line comment\n",
    "                      print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This is also a comment at the end of a line\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Multi-line comments (Docstrings): Multi-line comments are often referred to as docstrings. Docstrings are enclosed in triple-quotes (''' or \"\"\") and are used to provide documentation for functions, classes, and modules.\n",
    "            Example : \n",
    "                        '''This is a multi-line comment (docstring)It can have multiple lines and is often used to document functions and modules.'''\n",
    "                        def example_function():\n",
    "                                \"\"\"This is also a docstring.\"\"\"\n",
    "                                print(\"Example function\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Note**: While triple-quotes are commonly used for docstrings, they are not technically comments. Docstrings are a form of documentation and are accessible at runtime using the .__doc__ attribute."

    "### Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans.\n",
    "    In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that is used to store and reference data. Variables are essentially containers for values, and they allow you to manipulate data in your programs. The way to declare and assign values to variables in Python is given below:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Declaration and Assignment:\n",
    "        1. Variable Naming Rules: \n",
    "            * Name must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore ('_').\n",
    "            * Other characters can be letters, numbers or underscores.\n",
    "            * Variable names are case-sensitive ('my_var' is different from 'my_Var')\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Declaration and Assignment:\n",
    "            * We need not to explicitly declare a variable's type in Python; the interpreter dynamically infers the type.\n",
    "            * To assign a value to a variable, use the '=' operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "            Examples: \n",
    "                var1 = 23\n",
    "                var2 = 'PWSkills'\n",
